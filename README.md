#Raspberry Pi Face Tracking

This is/was my bachelor degree thesis. It's basically a Python/OpenCV face tracker using Raspberry Pi.

##Setup
Install Python, OpenCV, ServoBlaster (https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits/tree/master/ServoBlaster) and mess with the config.ini file to properly configure it but it should work out of the box.

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask. I will answer gladly to any questions/bugs.
